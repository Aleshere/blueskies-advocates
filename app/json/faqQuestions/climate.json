            "question": "Isn't aviation only a small part of global emissions?",
            "answer": "While aviation contributes approximately 2% of global CO2 emissions, this figure underestimates its true climate impact. High-altitude emissions and non-CO2 effects increase aviation's contribution to about 3.5% of global climate change emissions. Moreover, the industry's growth trajectory suggests its share of emissions will rise significantly if unchecked."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why focus on aviation emissions?",
            "answer": "Aviation is responsible for about 3.5% of global climate change emissions when considering radiative forcing and non-CO2 effects like water vapour contrails. Despite this seemingly small percentage, the impact is significant because a relatively small proportion of the global population flies. In regions like the UK, for example, flights account for 8% of total emissions, and for frequent flyers, these trips can comprise over half of their annual carbon footprint."

        {
            "question": "What are radiative forcing and non-CO2 effects?",
            "answer": "Radiative forcing refers to the change in energy balance in the Earth's atmosphere due to factors like CO2 emissions. Non-CO2 effects from aviation include emissions of water vapor, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter at high altitudes, which have a disproportionately large warming effect compared to ground-level emissions."

            "question": "How do electric flights and green fuels fit into reducing aviation emissions?",
            "answer": "Technological solutions such as electric and hydrogen-powered flights are promising but not yet viable on a large scale. These innovations are not expected to be commercially available until at least 2035, and even then, will mainly be suitable for short-haul travel. Additionally, the production of batteries and electricity for electric aircraft has its own environmental impact. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is another proposed solution, but it often involves bio-fuels, which can drive deforestation, or synthetic fuels, which still rely on fossil fuels for production. Therefore, while these technologies are part of the solution, they are not a quick fix, and we need immediate action to reduce emissions."
